# LS-Pro-ES6-I

Topics:

 * => - used for ES6 functions, items before the arrow are passed in, items after are part of the function/return statement
 * Const - used in place of var (es6) for variables that won't change
 * Let - used in place of var (es6) for variables that do change
 * ...rest - used to pass in the remaining arguments when not assigned to a variable
 * Template Literals - allows string literals with the use of a backtick. eg. `string text ${expression} string text`


Refactor `script.js` to use proper ES6 syntax.
